 **# PDF Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation (Llama-2 7b) 

**## Overview**

This project presents a chatbot that can answer queries from PDF documents using a combination of language modeling and retrieval techniques. It's built with: 

* **Llama-2 7b model:** A powerful language model capable of generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** A technique that combines natural language generation and information retrieval to produce more comprehensive and accurate responses. 

**## Key Features:**

* Answers queries from a given PDF document using natural language understanding.
* Leverages the RAG technique to enhance response quality and accuracy.
* Provides relevant context from the PDF to support answers.
* Can be customized for specific domains or knowledge areas.

**## Requirements:**

* Google Colab environment (recommended)
* Required libraries: 
    * Mentioned in colab notebook

**## Usage Instructions:**

1. Open the Colab notebook (`PDF_Chatbot.ipynb`).
2. Upload the PDF document you want to query.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook to initialize the chatbot.
4. Enter your queries in the designated input cell.
5. The chatbot will generate responses based on the PDF content and RAG.

**## Potential Applications:**

* Rapidly extracting insights from research papers, reports, and other PDF documents.
* Answering open-ended questions about PDF content.
* Building knowledge bases or FAQ systems from PDF documents.
* Creating interactive learning experiences with PDF materials.

**## Further Exploration:**

* Experiment with different PDF documents and query types.
* Explore customization options for specific domains or tasks.
* Integrate the chatbot into other applications or workflows.
* Contribute to the project development on GitHub.

**## Additional Information:**

* For detailed technical explanations and usage examples, refer to the Colab notebook and project documentation.
